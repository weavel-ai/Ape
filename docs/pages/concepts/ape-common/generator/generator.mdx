# Generator

## Overview

The `Generator` class is used for generating responses from language models using prompts. It extends the `BaseGenerate` class and provides an implementation for the `generate` method.

## Methods

### generate

Asynchronous method to generate a response from the model.

**Parameters:**

- `prompt` (Prompt): The prompt to generate a response for.
- `inputs` (Dict[str, Any], optional): The inputs to the prompt. Defaults to {}.

**Returns:**
Union[str, Dict[str, Any], Type[BaseModel]]: The generated response.

## Usage

To use the `Generator` class, create an instance and call the `generate` method with the prompt and inputs:

```python
from ape.common import Generator

generate = Generator()
response = await generate(prompt, inputs)
```

The above is equivalent to:

```python
response = await prompt(**inputs)
```
