title: AverageGlobalMetric
description: A class that computes the average of local scores as the global metric.
---

## Overview

The `AverageGlobalMetric` class computes the average of local scores as the global metric. This class is a subclass of `BaseGlobalMetric` and provides an implementation for the `compute` method.

## Methods

### compute

Compute the average of local scores as the global metric.

**Parameters:**

- `results` (List[EvaluationResult]): The results from BaseMetric evaluations.

**Returns:**
GlobalMetricResult: The average score.

**Note:**
This method calculates the average score from the provided results. If the results list is empty, it returns a score of 0.0.

## Usage

To use the `AverageGlobalMetric` class, create an instance and call the `compute` method with the results from BaseMetric evaluations.

Example:

```python
from ape.common.metrics import MetricResult
from ape.common.global_metrics import AverageGlobalMetric

global_metric = AverageGlobalMetric()

results = [
    MetricResult(score=0.8),
    MetricResult(score=0.9),
]

average_score = global_metric.compute(results)
print(average_score)
```
